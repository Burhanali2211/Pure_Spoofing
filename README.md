# 🛡 External SSD Privacy OS Setup

This project provides a complete, privacy-hardened Linux environment on an external SSD.  
The goal is to create a portable, secure development OS where your main machine stays untouched and no data leaks occur.

---

## 🚀 **What this does**
- Installs a privacy-respecting Linux OS (example: Linux Mint) on your external SSD
- Sets up Node.js, VSCodium (telemetry-free VSCode), and essential tools
- Configures a firewall to block unwanted network traffic
- Disables telemetry, auto-updates, and analytics

---

## 📦 **Requirements**
- External SSD or high-speed USB (recommended: SSD for performance)
- A blank USB drive (to create the live Linux installer)
- A computer that supports booting from USB/external SSD
- Internet connection (for initial setup + downloads)

---

## ⚠ **DISCLAIMER**
Be *very careful* when choosing your drive during installation. If you choose the wrong device, you could wipe your main system!
